**Notes**:    

1. These are the number of confirmed cases of people tested in Public Health England labs and NHS hospitals (Pillar 1). The daily number of new cases tested by commercial partners (Pillar 2) are not currently available at local authority level. Further information about the pillars of the Government's mass testing programme are available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-our-testing-programmes" target="_blank">gov.uk</a>.     
2. The date of a confirmed case corresponds to the *specimen* date rather than the *reporting* date.           
3. There is a lag between the specimen date and the reporting date so recent data are likely to change. Public Health England <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about" target="_blank">recommend</a> that only cases reported more than 5 days ago should be treated as 'complete'.    
4. The number of *confirmed* cases is likely to be much lower than the *total* number of cases because not all people who report symptoms of coronavirus are being tested.    
5. Confirmed cases include patients, key workers and their families.     
6. Confirmed cases for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are combined.
